FIND A WAY TO SYNC NEW NODES AND/OR THEIR POSITIONS, CURRENTLY HAS DESYNCS

WORK OUT THE WIN SCREENS, CURRENTLY CRASHING DUE TO NOT HAVING POSITIONS?? IDK
(ALSO, when i DID get them to work the scenes werent being changed right.
i think i need to queue free all of the current scenes. of just add an if 
statement that goes back to the lobby instead of home if its online or not)

ADD A NAME THING, I THINK THE WAY THE TUT HAS IT SET UP IT OVERWRITES IT, 
MAKE IT NOT DO THAT AND THEN MAKE IT DISPLAY SO PEOPLE KNOW AT A GLANCE 
WHO THEY'RE CONTROLLING

ADD A THING TO TYPE IN ADRESS AND PORT INTO LOBBY FOR CONNECTION ANDYS

PROBABLY MORE
