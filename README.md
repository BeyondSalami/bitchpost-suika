# lil-bitch-suika

suika with bitchpost regulars. i just made it for the sake of learning more godot, only posted because it uses other people's identities i figured they should be able to play it. its spaghetti coded as a mf, so be warned if you wanna snoop around.

if you wanna build the current build on a pc, you need to download godot editor 4.4 and import the project than export it for your platform. also, the controls unbind themselves and settings dont save. i have zero idea what broke because it worked last update and i didnt change anything, also it works in the editor. good game well coded.
