# lil-bitch-suika

suika with bitchpost regulars. i just made it for the sake of learning more godot, only posted because it uses other people's identities i figured they should be able to play it. its spaghetti coded as a mf, so be warned if you wanna snoop around.

Theres a download for windows, but if you want to you can download godot yourself build it for your platform. its a really simple game, i think as long as you have a keyboard it will work on whatever.
